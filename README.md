# Infinite-Scrolling-Table

This project is a prototype React application that demonstrates an infinite scroll list with a mirrored view feature. It displays mock data in an infinite list format. The mirrored view functionality allows users to click on a mirror icon in the top right corner to open a duplicate list that syncs with the scrolling of the original list. This means that scrolling in one list will simultaneously scroll the other, providing a synchronized viewing experience.
